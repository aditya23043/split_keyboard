- 30-34 key ortholinear keyboard 
- Instead of a fully covering case, I will have 3 layers of acrylic
    - One for bottom plate, one for switch mount and one for top part so that it seems like the switches are flushed onto the 3rd layer
    - and all three of these will be held by m3x25mm spacers and m3x6mm screws
    - Since the distance between the bottom plate and swtich mount plate should be atleast 8mm, im picking
