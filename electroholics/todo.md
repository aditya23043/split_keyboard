# Materials
- PCB
- Order M2 screws from https://onlyscrews.in

# NOTES
- I need atleast 1.9mm gap below pcb for the pins of the MX switch to go
	- 3.5mm distance between bottom of switch pin and the part that rests on the pcb
	- 1.6mm is the pcb height

- Exactly 3.5mm gap between the switch mount plate and the PCB

- OLD PLAN: I will be using m3 6mm standoffs near the MCU to distance the pcb from the case even though :CROSS:
	- because I only need ~1.9mm distance which I am hoping to attain using steps in the 3d case
	- I don't think I need extra gap since everything is connected in the PCB itself
	- Or I could use heat inserts in the case and m2 and m3 screws to mount them
		- Length of the screws = 3.5(switch)+3(brass insert)=6.5 (mm), so, I'll make do with the next nearest high screw i.w. m2x8 (8mm height)
		- Or I should use m2x6? because then the screws will sit flush and just 0.5mm of the brass insert will not be filled and since I dont need anything between the pcb and the bottom case, it will work ig
		- Conclusion: I am getting both m2x6 and m2x8
			- Note: Philips pan head screws are very cheap as compared to other styles of switches
		- I need 8 screws for one of this pcb
